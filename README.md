## Written Report:

1. Merged school and student datasets in order to analyze data
2. Created high level snapshot of the district which included:
    -Total Students, Total Budget, Average Math Score, Average Reading Score, % Passing Math, % Passing Reading, and % Overall Passing
3. Created school level snapshot which included the above mentioned plus:
    - School name and per student budget
4. Filtered schools by reading and math scores to discover:
    - Highest/lowest overall passing % schools, as well as how each individual grade performed
5. Filtered by school type, spending, and size

One assumption I had going into this project would be that a higher budget would yield higher grades.  However, based on the data, it seems the opposite is true.  When the data was filtered by per student spending it seemed that lower budgets yielded better overall grades from students.  This is a bit misleading though, as school type seemed to be a better indicator as to how students would perform.  Charter schools outperformed district schools in all academic categories.  One thing to note about the district schools is that they have fewer students than the district schools.  Fewer students combined with a charter schools flexibility in how they approach teaching seems to yield better understanding, especially with math.  The difference between district and charter school students passing math was 20-25% in favor of charter schools.
